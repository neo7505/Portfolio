Since 2005, I&#8217;ve worked at a range of startups, agencies, tech companies and corporations. I enjoy the challenge of solving complex customer problems and planning the user experience from the ground up, from research and discovery all the way through to the visual designs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve been lucky enough to have my work <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adhamdannaway.com\/featured\">featured in a bunch of books and publications<\/a> around the world, and I enjoy sharing my knowledge and love of design by <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AdhamDannaway\">tweeting<\/a>, blogging and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adhamdannaway.com\/portfolio\/rethinking-flight-search\">speaking at design events<\/a> (that\u2019s a lie, I actually find public speaking quite scary &#x1f631;).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it\u2019s important to get regular screen downtime, so when I\u2019m not pushing pixels, you\u2019ll find me working on my pull-ups, tending to my garden and many house plants, cooking up one of my favourite dishes, or hanging out with friends and family.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity is-style-wide\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"quick-facts-about-me\">Quick facts<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Home town<\/strong> <br>Sydney, Australia &#x1f1e6;&#x1f1fa; &#x1f998;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When I started as a designer<\/strong><br>2005 (in my pyjamas from my bedroom in my parent&#8217;s house).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Education<\/strong><br>Bachelor of Computer Science at UNSW, Master of Digital Media at UNSW, lots of online tutorials, and many years of practice and experimenting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Specialties<\/strong><br>UI design and design systems.

While I found creative ventures fun, I only ever pictured myself doing a regular \u2018stable\u2019 office job at a big company, because that\u2019s what adults do right? At the end of high school I had absolutely no idea what I wanted to do, or even what was out there, so I just followed a few of my friends into computer science at UNSW.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>University was tough, my friends and I spent most of our time stuck in the computer labs rushing to get our seemingly never ending list of assignments done on time. The computer labs were eerily dark and quiet, with the smell of stale corn chips looming in the freezing cold air conditioned air. Luckily, someone always sent around a secret link to Quake 3 which made it bearable. Programming was cool, but I knew that something was missing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once I\u2019d graduated, I was lucky enough to score an IT internship at a big company. I jumped around different areas of the IT department, until one day I landed in the website design team. I loved the combination of digital art and programming and I was instantly hooked. From that point on, I started building and experimenting with all sorts of different websites. They weren\u2019t great at first, as seen in some of the relics below from 2005, but I used every project to land more clients, build my portfolio and gain further experience.<\/p>\n\n\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1360\" height=\"1402\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.adhamdannaway.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/my-first-websites-1.jpg\" alt=\"Adham Dannaway's first websites\" class=\"wp-image-597 shadow\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.adhamdannaway.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/my-first-websites-1.jpg 1360w, https:\/\/www.adhamdannaway.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/my-first-websites-1-291x300.jpg 291w, https:\/\/www.adhamdannaway.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/my-first-websites-1-768x792.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px\" \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>After my internship, I decided to study a Masters of Digital Media at UNSW to further my skills, and freelanced on the side to pay the bills. Looking back, I probably didn\u2019t need my university degrees to be a designer. Then again, there weren\u2019t as many online UX design tutorials and courses back then. Come to think of it, &#8220;UX design&#8221; wasn&#8217;t even a thing yet! <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After finishing my masters, I had a pretty decent amount of work under my belt which helped me get my first job at a small marketing company. I recommend working at small companies when you\u2019re first starting out, as you\u2019ll really get your hands dirty on a variety of work.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My first job was going really well, but sadly after 2 years, the company went under and made everyone redundant. It was tough, but when life gives you lemons, you make a portfolio website. I locked myself in my room for nearly a month. My goal was to create a unique portfolio website that would put me on the map as a designer. No mean feat, I knuckled down for days on end until I finally came up with an idea I didn\u2019t hate. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The concept was to split a photo of my face in half to symbolise my split design and development skill set. I <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smashingmagazine.com\/2013\/06\/workflow-design-develop-modern-portfolio-website\/\">created a personal brand and website<\/a> around this concept (seen below) that luckily <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adhamdannaway.com\/blog\/web-design\/imitation-truly-is-the-sincerest-form-of-flattery\">went viral<\/a> amongst the design community. That same design has stood the test of time, and remains unchanged over a decade later (although I think it\u2019s probably time to blow off the cobwebs). So getting made redundant was actually a blessing in disguise.<\/p>\n\n\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1360\" height=\"1402\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.adhamdannaway.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/adham-dannaway-portfolio-website.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-608 shadow\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.adhamdannaway.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/adham-dannaway-portfolio-website.jpg 1360w, https:\/\/www.adhamdannaway.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/adham-dannaway-portfolio-website-291x300.jpg 291w, https:\/\/www.adhamdannaway.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/adham-dannaway-portfolio-website-768x792.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px\" \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>With my shiny new portfolio website in hand, I went on to work at start-ups, tech companies, agencies and corporations, absorbing as much knowledge and skills as I could. Along the way, I also built a social media following by sharing design tips, news and inspiration, which helped reinforce my brand.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m currently a product designer doing contract work and enjoy the variety and freedom that this style of work provides. There\u2019s always a new problem to solve, and I\u2019m glad to still be making things, just like I was when I was a kid.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity is-style-wide\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"things-I've-learned\">Key things I&#8217;ve learned<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a few key takeaways I&#8217;ve learned over my years as a designer. They&#8217;ve come in handy for me, hopefully they&#8217;ll come in handy for you too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Less is more <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Design can be a subjective and creative art form, but it\u2019s also logical and scientific. While I like to craft beautiful products, I also believe that every detail of your product or UI should have a specific purpose and should earn its place. Less is definitely more when it comes to design. Start with a blank canvas and add only what&#8217;s needed. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s take website typography as an example: Start with simple black text on a white background as a base. Headings are made larger or bolder to create hierarchy. Links are coloured blue and underlined to show that they\u2019re clickable. Adding layers of detail purposefully in this way will ensure that you end up with a user-friendly and beautiful product. It will also mean that you&#8217;re able to articulate the reasons behind your design decisions, which is what good design is all about. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Keep learning and challenging yourself<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In any profession, it\u2019s easy to stagnate and get comfortable. It&#8217;s important for me to read and absorb as much as I can to stay passionate about my craft and to continue to challenge myself and those around me. I try to set aside some time each morning to read and learn something new. Here are some of my favourite newsletters I enjoy reading with my morning tea:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/mvpublication.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Minimal Viable Publication<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/heydesigner.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Hey Designer<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.indiehackers.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Indie Hackers<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Market yourself and share the love<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>From early on in my career, I started building my brand and sharing design news, tips, resources and inspiration. Not only does having a strong brand help me get clients and jobs, it also helps give me a voice and an audience to share my love of design with. You can get some good freebies too, so I\u2019d definitely recommend creating a memorable brand profile and building it up over time. Here&#8217;s how I <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smashingmagazine.com\/2013\/06\/workflow-design-develop-modern-portfolio-website\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">created my brand and website<\/a> back in the day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Don\u2019t use a cannon to kill a mosquito<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While I believe that user research and usability testing are critical components to building a good product, I also think that designers need to trust their gut more and have their own vision. I\u2019ve found that many designers these days seem to have become slaves to usability testing and user research, throwing hundreds of different UX techniques at relatively simple problems. Do we really need a competitor analysis, a contextual enquiry, a survey, user interviews, a heuristic review, a user journey diagram and a SWOT analysis just to change the colour of a button? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re trying to kill mosquitos with cannons and spending a lot of time and money doing so. If we use tried and tested design patterns, we can cut down our UX process to become more lean, efficient, cost-effective problem solvers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Done is better than perfect<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re like me, you\u2019re probably a stickler for detail. This can however eat up valuable time and money, so I\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s usually better to get a product out there as soon as you can, learn from it and improve it over time. This isn\u2019t an excuse to create crap, but more of a reminder that perfectionism can actually get in the way of designing a great product.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity is-style-wide\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve made it this far, I hope you&#8217;ve learned a little bit more about me and my journey as a designer.
